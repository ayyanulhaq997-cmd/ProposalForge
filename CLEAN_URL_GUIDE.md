# Remove Replit Tags - Use Production URL

## The Issue

If you're seeing Replit tags, errors, or development banners, it's because you're viewing the app through **Replit's embedded preview** (`0f072637-70e2-4b9d-aa37...`).

Replit's preview shows development warnings and error messages.

## Solution: Use the Production URL

### ✅ Clean Production URL (No Replit Tags)
```
https://proposalforge-production-0b37.up.railway.app/
```

**This is the CLEAN version with NO Replit tags or development UI**

### ❌ Replit Preview (Shows Dev Warnings)
```
https://0f072637-70e2-4b9d-aa37-6ac91228d5cc-00-l8v5n56in4fq.spock.replit.dev/
```

This shows Replit development environment tags.

## What to Do

### For You (Developer)

### For Your Client
1. **Give them:** `https://proposalforge-production-0b37.up.railway.app/`
