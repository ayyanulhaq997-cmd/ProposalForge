I want to launch a vacation rental website that allows users to book accommodations for specific dates and times. I'm looking for two options: one for individual use and another as a SaaS application where hosts and guests can register. This would involve a master panel to manage host accounts, with each host having their own individual access panel. The application must be fully customizable (home, hero, etc.) from the dashboard. It should also include a real-time chat with a conversation history, user status indicators (online/typing), and a login page. - Registration page (Users must validate their identity by uploading ID) - Social login options - Modern and vibrant design with color gradients - Dark/light mode with automatic system preference detection - Smooth animations - Fully responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop) - Hero page with background image and animations - Advanced search bar - Featured properties grid - Filters by category - Property details - Image gallery with carousel - Complete accommodation information - Booking panel with price calculation - Review system - Host information User Dashboard • Booking view • Personal statistics • Stay history • Profile management Administrator Dashboard • General statistics • Property CRUD • Booking management • Occupancy and revenue analysis • Property exploration • Complete property listing • Advanced filter system • Search by location, price, type • Favorites • Saved property management • Quick view of favorites Main scope • Payment gateway: Full integration for credit and debit cards, ideally with Stripe and Square. (Configurable from the dashboard) • Booking module: calendar with real-time availability, room blocking, and automatic user confirmations. • Administration panel: creation and editing of accommodations, payment and booking management, basic reports. • Essential sections such as catalog, user accounts, and booking history. • Best security practices (HTTPS, encrypted data) and a minimum of technical SEO. • Clear documentation for deployment and maintenance. Expected deliverables: • Complete source code and production-ready database. • Installation and configuration instructions. • Details of the stack used and estimated development time. I value prior experience, payment integrations, and booking systems. Please share your portfolio or examples of similar projects and clarify any questions you may have about the requirements. Images of the expected design are attached for some sections. Suggested technologies: Backend/API: Node.js, NestJS, PostgreSQL, Prisma, WebSockets, Tokens, JWT, Firebase storage; Frontend: Next.js
