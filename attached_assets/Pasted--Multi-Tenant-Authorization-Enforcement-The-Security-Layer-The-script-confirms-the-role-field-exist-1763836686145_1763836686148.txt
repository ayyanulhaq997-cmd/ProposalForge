 Multi-Tenant Authorization Enforcement (The Security Layer)The script confirms the role field exists, but it offers "Phase 2: Role-based authorization guards" as the next step. This means the enforcement is missing.Missing ComponentWhy It's MissingArchitectural Necessity@Roles() Decorator & RolesGuardNot implemented. The code to check a user's role against a route's requirement is absent.CRITICAL for Multi-Tenancy. Without this, any authenticated user can access API endpoints meant only for Hosts or Admins (e.g., creating a property or managing users).Authorization Flow VisualizationThis involves checking the JWT, extracting the role, and validating it against the route metadata.|2. File Storage Implementation (The Media Logic)The script mentions "Storage Interface - Updated with Media and Payment CRUD operations." This implies the TypeScript interface is defined, but the functional code to talk to a file system is missing.Missing ComponentWhy It's MissingArchitectural NecessityCloud Storage Service ImplementationNot implemented. A real SaaS requires an integration with S3, GCS, or Azure Blob Storage. The service logic must handle uploading raw bytes, generating secure URLs, and handling file deletion.The platform cannot physically store property images/videos. The current Media model is useless until this service is built.Media Upload EndpointNot implemented. The controller method that uses NestJS's FileInterceptor and calls the StorageService to accept a file is missing.The host has no way to submit photos to the platform.3. Core Booking and Availability LogicThis is the central function of the application, and it is not mentioned as complete.Missing ComponentWhy It's MissingArchitectural NecessityAvailability Check ServiceNot implemented. This service must query the database to verify that the requested checkInDate and checkOutDate for a specific property do not overlap with any existing confirmed Booking or manually blocked Availability dates.The platform will accept double bookings without this logic.Advanced Search LogicNot implemented. The service logic to query properties based on complex filters (price range, location, category, availability) is missing.Guests cannot effectively find properties without this feature.4. Real-time Chat PersistenceThe script says the WebSocket senderId fix is applied, but not that the chat works.Missing ComponentWhy It's MissingArchitectural NecessityWebSocket Gateway PersistenceNot implemented. The NestJS Gateway logic is missing the handler that receives a message from the sender, saves it to the Message database table, and then forwards (broadcasts) it to the specific recipient.Chat messages will not be saved or delivered in real-time until this is built.|5. Administration and Financial ComplianceNone of the complex, required admin features are listed as complete.Missing ComponentWhy It's MissingArchitectural NecessityStripe Commission/Tax FinalizationNot implemented. The precise calculation of the 6.25% commission and tax within the StripeService is missing, which is necessary before creating the final Payment record.Necessary for accurate financial records and host payouts.Admin Dashboard EndpointsNot implemented. All API endpoints to retrieve analytics data (total users, booking counts, total income) and audit logs are missing.The Super Admin has no visibility or control over the platform's performance.Manual ID Verification WorkflowNot implemented. The service logic and endpoints for hosts to submit identification and for the admin to approve or deny the verification status are missing.Essential compliance and trust feature for the platform.
