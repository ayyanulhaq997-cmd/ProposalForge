Access & Data Isolation Checks
This verifies the security and the core SaaS architecture.

Host Login/Registration: Ensure the host registration process is smooth, including the required ID upload step.

Unique Access: After logging in as a Host, try manually changing the URL in the address bar to a page you know belongs to the Admin or another Host (e.g., if you see .../host/dashboard, try changing it to .../admin/dashboard or .../host/123/dashboard for another host's ID).

PASS: The system must immediately block your access or redirect you back to your own Host dashboard.

Data Isolation: If you have access to two different Host accounts (Host A and Host B), log into Host A.

PASS: Host A must only see properties, bookings, and revenue data belonging to Host A.

2. 🏠 Property Management (CRUD)
This checks the primary function of the panel—creating and managing listings.

Creation Flow: Click "Add New Property." Verify that the form is comprehensive, easy to navigate (e.g., using a step-by-step wizard), and includes all necessary fields:

Name, Description, Location.

Image Gallery Upload (Check if this works quickly, verifying your Firebase integration).

Pricing: Base rate, cleaning fee, minimum stay.

Amenities/Rules.

Editing (Update): Make a change to a property description or price.

PASS: The change must reflect on the public listing page immediately.

Deletion (Delete): Temporarily delete a test listing.

PASS: The property should instantly disappear from the public catalog.

3. 🗓️ Booking & Financial Management
This verifies the functionality that impacts the host's income.

Booking Calendar: Navigate to the calendar view for a property.

Test: Manually block out several dates (e.g., for maintenance).

PASS: The public guest booking widget must instantly reflect these blocked dates.

Revenue & Payouts: Check the Statistics/Revenue tab.

PASS: The charts must clearly show the Host's Net Income (Total Revenue minus your Platform Commission).

Booking History: Check the list of past and upcoming bookings.

PASS: Each entry should clearly show the Guest's Name, Stay Dates, and Amount Earned.

4. ⚙️ Settings & Communication
This verifies the secondary, but vital, features.

Profile Management: Ensure the Host can easily update their personal profile, contact information, and bank details (if applicable).

Real-Time Chat Access: Navigate to the Messages panel.

PASS: The interface should load quickly, and any existing conversations with guests must be visible.

Property Settings: Check if the Host can customize local settings for their properties (e.g., change check-in times or cancellation policies).

💡 Visualizing the Data Structure
Understanding the Host Panel requires understanding how the data is stored. In your system, the host is a primary entity connected directly to properties and bookings. The successful operation of the Host Panel relies on this structure being correctly isolated:
